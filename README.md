# Project "Quake" Readme

## Purpose

The project "Quake" has been initiated for several compelling reasons:

1. **Integration of Fire Alarm and Earthquake Detection**: "Quake" is designed to seamlessly integrate both fire alarm mechanisms and earthquake detection tools. This integration allows for real-time monitoring of potential threats, providing users with advanced warnings against sudden fires and seismic activities.

2. **Immediate Visual and Audio Alerts**: By incorporating a speaker into the system, "Quake" ensures that when an emergency is detected, an immediate visual and audio alert is triggered. This feature is invaluable in situations where residents may not immediately notice a hazard, offering an extra layer of safety.

3. **Real-Time Environmental Data**: The system provides real-time information on the current state of temperature, humidity, and seismic waves. Specifically, it displays the current acceleration of the accelerometer, which can be utilized for earthquake detection when correctly configured. This data empowers users with vital information about their surroundings.

4. **Protection Against Multiple Threats**: Our goal is to create a versatile system that offers protection against various threats, including gas leakages, fires, and earthquakes. The name "Quake" underscores the project's adaptability, emphasizing its capacity to deliver timely warnings in critical situations.

## Limitations of the Current System

While "Quake" is a powerful system, it does have certain limitations, including:

1. **Maintenance and Software Updates**: Regular maintenance and software updates are essential to ensure the system's accuracy and reliability. Neglecting these aspects may lead to potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies. Users are strongly encouraged to maintain the system to keep it in optimal condition.

2. **Hardware Limitations (Sensors)**: The system's performance depends on the sensors used. With unlimited financial resources, we could have employed state-of-the-art sensors, such as the Raspberry Shake, renowned for their exceptional efficiency. This would have enabled the creation of an even more robust system.

3. **Necessity of a Constant Energy Source**: As the system is designed for stationary use, it inherently lacks mobility and mandates a constant and direct connection to a reliable power source at all times.

## Intended Audience

**Stakeholders**: mentors, project coordinators, module coordinators.

**Users**: homeowners, business owners, emergency services, environmental services, insurance companies, researchers, environmental activists, etc.
